Most code has come from here

Some is from these two.

A ridiculous amount of key points of assistance has been provided by Simon Sarris at Stackoverflow.
Thanks

DEV PATH // TODO list
==========================
Here's a rough set of ideas I'd like to add:

1) performance
	- quad trees
	- something about not using closures in the main game loop
	- (thanks to devdave, the author of PING for these points)

2) game mechanics 
	- 'kill ability'
	- kill counter
	- other monsters
	- 

3) multiplayer / websockets
	- set up a node.js server
	- see who else is 'minotauring'
	- bookmarklet-ification (load anywhere!)

4) prettying up
	- background tile-map

5) Monetization
	- sponsors ? 
	- hall of fame / donorlists ? 
	- adsense ?
	- barter for a free copy of Portal2 ?
	- meh ?
